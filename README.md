Plot Wheeler-Kiladis power spectrum as done in WK99 paper. Based on the original wk_spectra Python code written by Alejandro Jaramillo in 2018. I do not claim have any ownership to the original code.
Changes have been made to save the spectra plot as variables in netCDF format and custom plot the spectra.
